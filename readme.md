# Description

Adds a function to Garry's Mod for Base64Decode in gLua. Because gmod apparently doesn't have
this but has Base64Encode for some reason. While others have writen a Base64Decode in lua already
I felt doing it in C++ would be some what better.

# Compiling

Compiling supports Windows, Linux and MacOSx aswell as x86_64 support


# Credits

General -HeX- | Creating the module the Base64Decode originally came from

Vaas Kahn Grim | Seperating the function from the potential risky functions involving file i/o and
updating things for vs2019 and premake5
